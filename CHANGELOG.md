# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — unreleased

- Standalone dogfooding: committed `sandbox/` plugin + config, `sandbox:*`
  scripts (http / https / ngrok / persistent start on basePort 9880) and
  `.claude/launch.json` preview entries — no consumer repo needed. The sandbox
  dashboard widget and `GET /wp-json/krokedil-sandbox/v1/ping` echo transport
  diagnostics.
- `init` refuses to run inside this package itself (it would inject a
  self-referential git dependency and rewrite the repo's own files).
- `ensurePrereqs` skips `pnpm install` for roots without a `package.json`,
  and fails actionably when `build` is configured without one.
- Dev tooling: `CLAUDE.md`, prettier (`format`/`format:check`,
  `@wordpress/prettier-config`), `.editorconfig`, `lint:fix`, and `php -l`
  over all shipped PHP in CI.
- CI: fixed the smoke job's pnpm setup (the subdirectory checkout hid the
  `packageManager` field from `pnpm/action-setup`) — the job now actually
  boots the fixture plugin.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-29

Initial release, extracted from returns-and-withdrawals' `tools/` setup.

- One-command bootstrap + launcher (`start`, `server <mode>`, `setup`) with
  marker-keyed prerequisites (composer / pnpm / JS build), Node 20 provisioning
  guard, worktree site isolation and automatic port resolution.
- Blueprints generated from `playground.config.mjs` via a shared step library
  (WooCommerce baseline, demo store cascade, debug plugin bundle, declarative
  seeding), staged with runtime assets under `.playground/`.
- `--tunnel` (ngrok, pluggable) and `--https` (mkcert + local reverse proxy)
  via the `playground-proxy-url.php` runtime mu-plugin — no DB writes.
- PR screenshot + collage engine (Playwright) driven by a per-plugin manifest.
- `init` scaffolder for onboarding plugins (`--update` refreshes generated files).
- Changes vs the original in-plugin tooling: env vars renamed `RWWC_*` →
  `KROKEDIL_PG_*`; `@wp-playground/cli@3.1.29` is a packaged dependency instead
  of an inline `npx` pin; the e2e blueprint is opt-in (`modes`); blueprint page
  creation is idempotent `runPHP` instead of `wp post create`.
